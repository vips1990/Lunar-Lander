# Lunar-Lander
In the OpenAI Gym game Lunar Lander (https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) the player's job is to control a small spaceship to land if safely on a landing pad. There are three thrusters which can be used for control. These work in three directions: up, left, and right. The player can also choose to do nothing. A dataset has been collected from an expert player of LunarLander that contains screenshots of the state of the game and the player's associated action (none, up, left, and right). A dataset describing the same scenario using high-level derived features representing the state of the Lunar Lander world has also been collected through the same process.
